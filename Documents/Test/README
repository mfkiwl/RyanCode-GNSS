# Test

This is the file system used to Test the Pyxis Code.

The directory structure is:

	conf_swc - saved conf_swc.h files that are specific to each test
	input - IF data as binary files
	MATLAB - Griffin's matlab code
	output - where all output is saved as well as summaries
	Pyxis_current - site of current Pyxis code
	ShScripts - where all shell scripts used for testing are located, except for Start.sh

Before you begin:

	Make sure that all the directories are changed in the shell scripts. It is set up so that you
	only need to change the first cd command at the start of each script as well as the sed commands
	in the cores.

Instructions:

	Run Start12h.sh

Explanation:

	Start12h.sh begins the testing by first compiling/making pyxis and distributing it to the appropriate 
	folders. This process is encapsulated in Build.sh. 

	Once Build.sh is finished, Core1.sh, Core2.sh, and Core3.sh are started. They run pyxis and then run 
	matlab. The first core deals with the ARM test while the second core deals with the static/dynamic test. 
	The third core deals with the long StaticSim test.

	After all cores are completed, then Performance.sh is ran, which extracts the important information 
	and condenses it into one file.
